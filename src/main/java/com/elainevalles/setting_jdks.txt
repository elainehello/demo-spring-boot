# Step-by-step guide to setting up JDK installations in ~/.jdks directory
# Eclipse Temurin JDK/JRE Hotspot, check with version is suitable for your project
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Ensure SDKMAN is installed first (required for managing Java installations)
# 2. Have proper internet connection for downloading JDK
#
# Installation Process:
# 1. Create ~/.jdks directory if it doesn't exist, mkdir -p ~/.jdks
# 2. Use SDKMAN to install desired JDK version
# 3. Configure environment variables (JAVA_HOME and PATH)
# 4. Verify installation
#
# Example usage:
# 1. First install SDKMAN if needed:
#    curl -fsSL https://sdkman.io/install | bash
#
# 2. Then install JDK (replace version as needed):
#    sdk install java 21.0.7-tem
#
# 3. Set environment variables:
#    export JAVA_HOME=~/.sdks/java/$(sdk current java)
#    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
#
# 4. Verify installation:
#    java --version
#    javac --version
#
# Note: SDKMAN installs JDKs in ~/.sdks/java/, but creates symlinks in ~/.jdks/
#       Both directories serve different purposes in the Java ecosystem.
